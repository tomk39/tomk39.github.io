##### **Hi folks,**
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
Welcome to my blog! I’m Tomislav Kranjec, Head of IT, Network Consultant and Network Architect with over 20 years of experience working with telecom operators, system integrators, oil and gas companies, and trading firms across the globe. I am Cisco and Juniper certified, and my career has been defined by hands-on involvement in diverse, multi-vendor network projects, spanning Service Provider, Enterprise, and Data Center environments.
In the last five years, I’ve focused on Cloud networking, virtualization, and automation, staying at the forefront of technological innovation. My work on global projects has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and soft skills, enabling me to bridge the gap between business objectives and technical solutions effectively.
Through this blog, I aim to share the wealth of knowledge I’ve gained from my extensive experience, offering insights into networking, emerging technologies, and the interplay between business and technical strategies.
Beyond my professional life, I’m passionate about sports, books, and exploring all things related to new technologies. My mission is simple: to connect ideas, solutions, and people in the ever-evolving world of technology.
