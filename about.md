##### **Hi folks,**
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
My name is Tomislav Kranjec. I have been working for telecom operators and system operators for over 20 years. I am Cisco and Juniper certified. During my careers I was working on many projects all around the globe. I had chance to work with multi-vendor network equipment. Working on projects I gained many technical as well soft skills which always help me to better understand relationship between business and technical side of project. I have experience with Service Provider, Enterprise and Data center networks, last five years I was focused on Cloud networking, Virtualization and automation. I collected a lot of the knowledge which I would like to share with you and that is the reason why I decide to create this blog. BTW I like sports, books and all things related to new technologies.

So, letâ€™s connect everything what is not connected already! <img style="float" width="15" height="15" src="/images/rocket.jpg">
